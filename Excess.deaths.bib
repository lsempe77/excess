abstract = {Introduction: Over 80{\%} of rural households in Peru use solid fuels as their primary source of domestic energy, which contributes to several health problems. In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusi{\'{o}}n Social Energ{\'{e}}tico (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness – Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Results: The FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100{\%} of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in {\textgreater}95{\%} of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5{\%} reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE. Conclusion: The FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use.},

Bulgaria, New Zealand, Slovakia, Australia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced mortality changes that ranged from possible small declines to increases of 5{\%} or less in either sex. The heterogeneous mortality effects of the COVID-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standardized mortality surveillance data, capable of detecting variations in total mortality at population level and not only among the infected, provide an unbiased insight into the impact of epidemics, like COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease). We analysed the temporal trend in total excess mortality and deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 by geographical area (north and centre-south), age and sex, taking into account the deficit in mortality in previous months. METHODS: Data from the Italian rapid mortality surveillance system was used to quantify excess deaths during the epidemic, to estimate the mortality deficit during the previous months and to compare total excess mortality with deaths among positive cases of SARS-CoV-2. Data were stratified by geographical area (north vs centre and south), age and sex. RESULTS: COVID-19 had a greater impact in northern Italian cities among subjects aged 75-84 and 85+ years. COVID-19 deaths accounted for half of total excess mortality in both areas, with differences by age: almost all excess deaths were from COVID-19 among adults, while among the elderly only one third of the excess was coded as COVID-19. When taking into account the mortality deficit in the pre-pandemic period, different trends were observed by area: all excess mortality during COVID-19 was explained by deficit mortality in the centre and south, while only a 16{\%} overlap was estimated in northern cities, with quotas decreasing by age, from 67{\%} in the 15-64 years old to 1{\%} only among subjects 85+ years old. CONCLUSIONS: An underestimation of COVID-19 deaths is particularly evident among the elderly. When quantifying the burden in mortality related to COVID-19, it is important to consider seasonal dynamics in mortality. Surveillance data provides an impartial indicator for monitoring the following phases of the epidemic, and may help in the evaluation of mitigation measures adopted.},

abstract = {Importance: Efforts to track the severity and public health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States have been hampered by state-level differences in diagnostic test availability, differing strategies for prioritization of individuals for testing, and delays between testing and reporting. Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19. Objective: To estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020. Design, Setting, and Population: This observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Increases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results: There were approximately 781000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122300 (95{\%} prediction interval, 116800-127000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28{\%} higher than the official tally of COVID-19-reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Excess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus. The mortality burden and the completeness of the tallies vary markedly between states..},

abstract = {National predictions of the course of COVID mortality can be used to plan for effective healthcare responses as well as to support COVID policymaking. We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48{\%}-92{\%} over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7{\%}-55{\%} over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13{\%} excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34{\%} excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.

abstract = {Background: Mortality statistics derived from cause of death data are an important source of information for population health monitoring, priority setting and planning. In Per{\'{u}}, almost all death certificates are issued by doctors because it is a legal requirement. However, the quality of cause of death data is poor. In August 2016, the Ministry of Health of Per{\'{u}} decided to make two specific interventions to improve cause of death data: to introduce an online death certification system and to train doctors in standard death certification practices. Methods: The study comprised a random sample of 300 pre-intervention death certificates, 900 death certificates that were part of the online intervention, and 900 death certificates that were part of both the online and training interventions. All the deaths had occurred between January and September 2017. We used the Assessing the quality of death certification tool from the University of Melbourne for the assessment. We examined the frequency of common errors in death certificates, the frequency of any error and the average error score for each category of: age group, sex, doctor's seniority, doctor's speciality, level of health facility and broad cause of death. Results: The average error score declined by 38{\%} due to the online intervention and by a further 26{\%} due to the training intervention. Improved certification practices remained after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Main improvements were reductions in the absence of a time interval (66{\%} of certificates), incorrect sequence of causes (22{\%}), and ill-defined conditions (13{\%}). Conclusions: This study demonstrates how the two interventions introduced by the Ministry of Health in Per{\'{u}} improved the correctness of death certificates. The study also provides evidence on necessary changes to the training program to address the poor certification practices that have remained after implementation of the online system.},

The aim is to cut transmission by reducing close contact (box 1), but the measures have profound consequences. Several sectors are seeing steep reductions in business, and there has been panic buying in shops. Social, economic, and health consequences are inevitable. Box 1: Social distancing measures • Advising the whole population to self-isolate at home if they or their family have symptoms • Bans on social gatherings (including mass gatherings) • Stopping flights and public transport • Closure of "non-essential" workplaces (beyond the health and social care sector, utilities, and the food chain) with continued working from home for those that can • Closure of schools, colleges, and universities • Prohibition of all "non-essential" population movement • Limiting contact for special populations (eg, care homes, prisons) The health benefits of social distancing measures are obvious, with a slower spread of infection reducing the risk that health services will be overwhelmed. But they may also prolong the pandemic and the restrictions adopted to mitigate it. 1 Policy makers need to balance these considerations while paying attention to broader effects on health and health equity.},

@article{Wang2017,
abstract = {Background: Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5{\%} and where VR systems were less than 65{\%} complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28{\%} in 1970 to a peak of 45{\%} in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates - a measure of relative inequality - increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95{\%} UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.},

abstract = {The prediction of future mortality rates is a problem of fundamental importance for the insurance and pensions industry. We show how the method of P-splines can be extended to the smoothing and forecasting of two-dimensional mortality tables. We use a penalized generalized linear model with Poisson errors and show how to construct regression and penalty matrices appropriate for two-dimensional modelling. An important feature of our method is that forecasting is a natural consequence of the smoothing process. We illustrate our methods with two data sets provided by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau, a central body for the collection and processing of UK insurance and pensions data.},

abstract = {Background: COVID-19 reached Latin-American countries slightly later than European countries, around February/March, allowing some emergency preparedness response in countries characterized by low health system capacities and socioeconomic disparities. Objective: This paper focuses on the first months of the pandemic in five Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It analyses how the pre-pandemic context, and the government's responses to contain and mitigate the spread together with economic measures have affected the COVID-19 health outcomes. Methods: Extensive qualitative document analysis was conducted focused on publicly-available epidemiological data and federal and state/regional policy documents since the beginning of the pandemic. Results: The countries were quick to implement stringent COVID-19 measures and incrementally scaled up their health systems capacity, although tracing and tracking have been poor. All five countries have experienced a large number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The analysis on the excess deaths also shows that the impact in deaths is far higher than the official numbers reported to date for some countries. Conclusion: Despite the introduction of stringent measures of containment and mitigation, and the scale up of health system capacities, pre-pandemic conditions that characterize these countries (high informal employment, and social inequalities) have undermined the effectiveness of the countries' responses to the pandemic. The economic support measures put in place were found to be too timid for some countries and introduced too late in most of them. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive strategy for testing and tracking has also contributed to the failure to contain the spread of the virus.},

abstract = {Deaths are frequently under-estimated during emergencies, times when accurate mortality estimates are crucial for emergency response. This study estimates excess all-cause, pneumonia, and influenza mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic using the September 11, 2020 release of weekly mortality data from the United States (U.S.) Mortality Surveillance System (MSS) from September 27, 2015 to May 9, 2020, using semiparametric and conventional time-series models in 13 states with high reported COVID-19 deaths and apparently complete mortality data: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We estimated greater excess mortality than official COVID-19 mortality in the U.S. (excess mortality 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) (100013, 127501) vs. 78834 COVID-19 deaths) and 9 states: California (excess mortality 95{\%} CI (3338, 6344) vs. 2849 COVID-19 deaths); Connecticut (excess mortality 95{\%} CI (3095, 3952) vs. 2932 COVID-19 deaths); Illinois (95{\%} CI (4646, 6111) vs. 3525 COVID-19 deaths); Louisiana (excess mortality 95{\%} CI (2341, 3183) vs. 2267 COVID-19 deaths); Massachusetts (95{\%} CI (5562, 7201) vs. 5050 COVID-19 deaths); New Jersey (95{\%} CI (13170, 16058) vs. 10465 COVID-19 deaths); New York (95{\%} CI (32538, 39960) vs. 26584 COVID-19 deaths); and Pennsylvania (95{\%} CI (5125, 6560) vs. 3793 COVID-19 deaths). Conventional model results were consistent with semiparametric results but less precise. Significant excess pneumonia deaths were also found for all locations and we estimated hundreds of excess influenza deaths in New York. We find that official COVID-19 mortality substantially understates actual mortality, excess deaths cannot be explained entirely by official COVID-19 death counts. Mortality reporting lags appeared to worsen during the pandemic, when timeliness in surveillance systems was most crucial for improving pandemic response.},

abstract = {Background: Globally, an estimated two-thirds of all deaths occur in the community, the majority of which are not attended by a physician and remain unregistered. Identifying and registering these deaths in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, and ascertaining the cause of death, is thus a critical challenge to ensure that policy benefits from reliable evidence on mortality levels and patterns in populations. In contrast to traditional processes for registration, death notification can be faster and more efficient at informing responsible government agencies about the event and at triggering a verbal autopsy for ascertaining cause of death. Thus, innovative approaches to death notification, tailored to suit the setting, can improve the availability and quality of information on community deaths in CRVS systems. Improving the notification of community deaths: Here, we present case studies in four countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea) that were part of the initial phases of the Bloomberg Data for Health Initiative at the University of Melbourne, each of which faces unique challenges to community death registration. The approaches taken promote improved notification of community deaths through a combination of interventions, including integration with the health sector, using various notifying agents and methods, and the application of information and communication technologies. One key factor for success has been the smoothing of processes linking notification, registration and initiation of a verbal autopsy interview. The processes implemented champion more active notification systems in relation to the passive systems commonly in place in these countries. Conclusions: The case studies demonstrate the significant potential for improving death reporting through the implementation of notification practices tailored to a country's specific circumstances, including geography, cultural factors, structure of the existing CRVS system, and available human, information and communication technology resources. Strategic deployment of some, or all, of these innovations can result in rapid improvements to death notification systems and should be trialled in other settings.},

abstract = {As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1-6).† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26-October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015-2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Italy was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group and period of the outbreak. METHODS The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time-series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015-May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. RESULTS In the period 15 February-15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47 490 [95{\%} empirical confidence intervals (eCIs): 43 984 to 50 362] deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5{\%} (95{\%} eCI: 26.8 to 31.9{\%}) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced increases up to 800{\%} during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. CONCLUSION This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to the implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.},

abstract = {Accurate information on mortality and causes of death is essential for program and policy development and monitoring in health, and other sectors. The most reliable source for death data is a well-functioning Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system; however, the CRVS systems are underdeveloped in Latin America, with varying levels of incompleteness between and within the countries 1,2. The Bloomberg Data For Health Initiative (D4H) identified four Latin American countries with functional CRVS systems, which lacked the capacity for providing high-quality mortality information with accurate causes of death for different reasons, including the inability to capture community deaths. These countries, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, joined the Initiative at various times. Their governments had a common desire to strengthen their CRVS systems by using evidence-based interventions to enable the timely flow of high-quality mortality information for the development of health policies and practices. A key outcome for D4H was that technical interventions should be collaboratively driven and ultimately sustainable by government partners. Brazil has a relatively high Vital Statistics Performance Index (VSPI) 1 and high completeness rate of death registration. However, deaths with an ill-defined underlying cause, or coded to non-specific causes (unusable or garbage codes), represented 33{\%} of all deaths in 2013 3. This high burden of garbage codes reflected the percentage of deaths occurring outside health facilities, the nature of the geography in some parts of the country that isolated rural populations from physicians who could certify cause of death, and poor medical certification practices in some areas. To address these},

abstract = {Background: The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK–CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 3{\textperiodcentered}0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0{\textperiodcentered}001{\%}), partial suppression (1{\%}), mitigation (10{\%}), and do nothing (80{\%}). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. Findings: We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] women and 1 904 077 [49{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}] men). We estimated that more than 20{\%} of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} were older than 70 years and 6{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4{\textperiodcentered}46{\%} (95{\%} CI 4{\textperiodcentered}41–4{\textperiodcentered}51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, four with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and seven with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 36 749 with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 293 991 with an RR of 2{\textperiodcentered}0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3{\textperiodcentered}0. Interpretation: We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

abstract = {Objective: Assess the completeness of the DataSUS SIM death-count registry, by sex and Brazilian state, and estimate the probability of adult mortality (45q15), by sex and state, from 1980 to 2010. Methods: The study was based on mortality data obtained in the DataSUS Mortality Information System, from 1980 to 2010, and on population data from the 1980, 1991, 2000, and 2010 demographic censuses. The quality assessment of the registry data was conducted using traditional demographic and death distribution methods, and death probabilities were calculated using life-table concepts. Results: The results show a considerable improvement in the completeness of the death-count coverage in Brazil since 1980. In the southeast and south, we observed the complete coverage of the adult mortality registry, which did not occur in the previous decade. In the northeast and north, there were still places with a low coverage from 2000 to 2010, although there was a clear improvement in the quality of data. For all Brazilian states, there was a decline in the probability of adult mortality; we observed, however, that the death probability for males is much higher than that for females throughout the whole analysis period. Conclusion: The observed improvements seem to be related to investments in the public health care system and administrative procedures to improve the recording of vital events.},

abstract = {Increasing demand for better quality data and more investment to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems will require increased emphasis on objective, comparable, cost-effective monitoring and assessment methods to measure progress. We apply a composite index (the vital statistics performance index [VSPI]) to assess the performance of CRVS systems in 148 countries or territories during 1980-2012 and classify them into five distinct performance categories, ranging from rudimentary (with scores close to zero) to satisfactory (with scores close to one), with a mean VSPI score since 2005 of 0{\textperiodcentered}61 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}31). As expected, the best performing systems were mostly in the European region, the Americas, and Australasia, with only two countries from east Asia and Latin America. Most low-scoring countries were in the African or Asian regions. Globally, only modest progress has been made since 2000, with the percentage of deaths registered increasing from 36{\%} to 38{\%}, and the percentage of children aged under 5 years whose birth has been registered increasing from 58{\%} to 65{\%}. However, several individual countries have made substantial improvements to their CRVS systems in the past 30 years by capturing more deaths and improving accuracy of cause-of-death information. Future monitoring of the effects of CRVS strengthening will greatly benefit from application of a metric like the VSPI, which is objective, costless to compute, and able to identify components of the system that make the largest contributions to good or poor performance.},

abstract = {Background and objective Many countries have used the new ANACONDA (Analysis of Causes of National Death for Action) tool to assess the quality of their cause of death data (COD), but no cross-country analysis has been done to verify how different or similar patterns of diagnostic errors and data quality are in countries or how they are related to the local cultural or epidemiological environment or to levels of development. Our objective is to measure whether the usability of COD data and the patterns of unusable codes are related to a country's level of socio-economic development. Methods We have assessed the quality of 20 national COD datasets from the WHO Mortality Database by assessing their completeness of COD reporting and the extent, pattern and severity of garbage codes, i.e. codes that provide little or no information about the true underlying COD. Garbage codes were classified into four groups based on the severity of the error in the code. The Vital Statistics Performance Index for Quality (VSPI(Q)) was used to measure the overall quality of each country's mortality surveillance system. Findings The proportion of ‘garbage codes' varied from 7 to 66{\%} across the 20 countries. Countries with a high SDI generally had a lower proportion of high impact (i.e. more severe) garbage codes than countries with low SDI. While the magnitude and pattern of garbage codes differed among countries, the specific codes commonly used did not. Conclusions There is an inverse relationship between a country's socio-demographic development and the overall quality of its cause of death data, but with important exceptions. In particular, some low SDI countries have vital statistics systems that are as reliable as more developed countries. However, in low-income countries, where most people die at home, the proportion of unusable codes often exceeds 50{\%}, implying that half of all cause-specific mortality data collected is of little or no use in guiding public policy. Moreover, the cause of death pattern identified from the data is likely to seriously under-represent the true extent of the leading causes of death in the population, with very significant consequences for health priority setting. Garbage codes are prevalent at all ages, contrary to expectations. Further research into effective strategies deployed in these countries to improve data quality can inform efforts elsewhere to improve COD reporting systems.},

abstract = {A month after the “urgent” review promised by England's health secretary, Public Health England (PHE) has announced new reporting definitions that bring England into line with Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland in how it records deaths from covid-19. However, experts warn that some deaths will still be missed by this new approach.

PHE's analysis showed that 88{\%} of deaths from covid-19 in England occurred within 28 days of a positive test result, while 96{\%} occurred within 60 days or had covid-19 on the death certificate. As a result, rather than counting anyone who had ever tested positive as a covid associated death, PHE will now use two definitions of death with covid-19 in England.

The first definition is death within 28 days of the first covid positive swab date. The second is death of someone with a laboratory confirmed positive covid-19 test who either died within 60 days of {\ldots}},

abstract = {Background Timely influenza surveillance is important to monitor influenza epidemics. Objectives (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross-validation procedure. Results The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71AE8{\%} and the specificity was 95AE5{\%}. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0-4AE5). Conclusions The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe. Please cite this paper as: Vega et al.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. In Brazil, 110 thousand cases and 5,901 deaths were confirmed by the end of April 2020. The scarcity of laboratory resources, the overload on the service network, and the broad clinical spectrum of the disease make it difficult to document all the deaths due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality rate in Brazilian capitals with a high incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed the weekly mortality between epidemiological week 1 and 16 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We estimated the expected mortality at 95{\%} confidence interval by projecting the mortality in 2019 to the population in 2020, using data from the National Association of Civil Registrars (ARPEN-Brasil). RESULTS: In the five capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, we identified excess deaths during the pandemic. The age group above 60 years was severely affected, while 31{\%} of the excess deaths occurred in the age group of 20-59 years. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between excess deaths and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological monitoring. The epidemiological surveillance captured only 52{\%} of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities examined. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the simplicity of the method and its low cost, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be used as a complementary tool for regular epidemiological surveillance.},

abstract = {There are a number of measures that quantify the public health burden due to specific risk factors for specific diseases. Although these measures are of importance for policymakers, epidemiologists do not often calculate them or may be unfamiliar with some of the issues involved when they do. The primary measure of interest is the attributable fraction (AF), representing the fraction of cases or deaths from a specific disease that would not have occurred in the absence of exposure to a specific risk factor either in the exposed population or the population as a whole. AFs can be multiplied by the total number of cases of a given disease to obtain a "body count"-the absolute number of preventable cases due to a specific risk factor. Two other measures of public health burden, used in conjunction with AFs, are attributable years-of-life-lost and attributable disability-adjusted life-years. We provide an overview of the AF and related measures and discuss some of the specific issues involved in calculating AFs. These issues include calculating the variance of AFs (such as Monte Carlo sensitivity methods), biases arising from some formulas for the AF, sources of data for calculating AFs, dependence of AFs on basic decisions about what exposure-disease associations are causal, and extrapolation from the source population to the target population.

abstract = {Background: Most of the 48 million annual deaths in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) occur without medical attention at the time of death so that the causes of death (COD) are largely unknown. A review of low-cost methods of obtaining nationally representative COD data is timely.Discussion: Despite clear historic evidence of their usefulness, most LMICs lack reliable nationally representative COD data. Indirect methods to estimate COD for most countries are inadequate, mainly because they currently rely on an average ratio of 1 nationally representative COD to every 850 estimated deaths in order to measure the cause of 25 million deaths across 110 LMICs. Direct measurement of COD is far more reliable and relevant for country priorities. Five feasible methods to expand COD data are: sample registration systems (which form the basis for the ongoing Million Death Study in India; MDS); strengthening the INDEPTH network of 42 demographic surveillance sites; adding retrospective COD surveys to the demographic household and health surveys in 90 countries; post-census retrospective mortality surveys; and for smaller countries, systematic assembly of health records. Lessons learned from the MDS, especially on low-cost, high-quality methods of verbal autopsy, paired with emerging use of electronic data capture and other innovations, can make COD systems low-cost and relevant for a wide range of childhood and adult conditions.Summary: Low-cost systems to obtain and report CODs are possible. If implemented widely, COD systems could identify disease control priorities, help detect emerging epidemics, enable evaluation of disease control programs, advance indirect methods, and improve the accountability for expenditures of disease control programs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Jha; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly, how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted forecasting of hospitalization and critical care needs.},

abstract = {Objective To analyse the design and operational status of India's civil registration and vital statistics system and facilitate the system's development into an accurate and reliable source of mortality data. Methods We assessed the national civil registration and vital statistics system's legal framework, administrative structure and design through document review. We did a cross-sectional study for the year 2013 at national level and in Punjab state to assess the quality of the system's mortality data through analyses of life tables and investigation of the completeness of death registration and the proportion of deaths assigned ill-defined causes. We interviewed registrars, medical officers and coders in Punjab state to assess their knowledge and practice. Findings Although we found the legal framework and system design to be appropriate, data collection was based on complex intersectoral collaborations at state and local level and the collected data were found to be of poor quality. The registration data were inadequate for a robust estimate of mortality at national level. A medically certified cause of death was only recorded for 965 992 (16.8{\%}) of the 5 735 082 deaths registered. Conclusion The data recorded by India's civil registration and vital statistics system in 2011 were incomplete. If improved, the system could be used to reliably estimate mortality. We recommend improving political support and intersectoral coordination, capacity building, computerization and state-level initiatives to ensure that every death is registered and that reliable causes of death are recorded – at least within an adequate sample of registration units within each state.},

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.22 deaths per million men per month (95{\%} CI: −14.45, −9.98) and 3.55 deaths per million women per month (95{\%} CI:-4.81, −2.30). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was 2.5 the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in homicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 6.66 deaths per million men per year (95{\%} CI:3.18, 10.15). External deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in homicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.},

abstract = {Background: Despite attempts to apply standard methods proven to work in high-income nations, nearly all civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems in low- and middle-income countries are failing to achieve adequate levels of registration completeness or produce the high-quality vital statistics needed to support better health outcomes and monitor progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. This suggests that, rather than simple technical issues, these countries are facing additional or different systemic challenges, including duplication of roles and responsibilities, inefficient methods of data collection, and a reluctance to change. Applying process management: Process management is a valuable tool that strengthens the production of vital statistics by providing a visualisation of data flow from start to finish. It helps identify gaps and bottlenecks in the process, allowing stakeholders to work collaboratively to find solutions and target interventions. As part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative at the University of Melbourne, 16 countries were supported in mapping the varied processes required in registering a birth or death. Comparative analysis exposed several limitations in the design of CRVS systems that hinder their performance - from 'passive' systems, to overly complex and fragmented system design, through to poor collaboration and duplication of efforts. Conclusions: The experiences from Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda reported in this paper illustrate the benefits of process management to improve CRVS. While these three countries are at different stages of system development, each uniquely benefited. Process management is a useful tool for all CRVS systems, from the most rudimentary to the most developed. It can strengthen CRVS systems and improve the quality and completeness of vital statistics, resulting in more robust, reliable and timely vital statistics for health planning and better monitoring of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal agenda.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed many lives in the UK and globally. The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as Covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. Reasons behind this might include Covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths in England and Wales that did not officially involve Covid-19 over the period 2015–2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a difference-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in deaths not registered as Covid-19-related during the pandemic, compared to a control. Results suggest that there were an additional 968 weekly deaths that officially did not involve Covid-19, compared to what would have otherwise been expected. It is possible that some people are dying from Covid-19 without being diagnosed, and/or that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. Analysing the cause of death for any excess non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.},

@article{Dicker2018,
abstract = {Background: Assessments of age-specifc mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Afairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. Methods: The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specifc mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in diferent components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. Findings: Globally, 18{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval 18{\textperiodcentered}4-19{\textperiodcentered}0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (58{\textperiodcentered}2-59{\textperiodcentered}3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48{\textperiodcentered}1 years (46{\textperiodcentered}5-49{\textperiodcentered}6) to 70{\textperiodcentered}5 years (70{\textperiodcentered}1-70{\textperiodcentered}8) for men and from 52{\textperiodcentered}9 years (51{\textperiodcentered}7-54{\textperiodcentered}0) to 75{\textperiodcentered}6 years (75{\textperiodcentered}3-75{\textperiodcentered}9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49{\textperiodcentered}1 years (46{\textperiodcentered}5-51{\textperiodcentered}7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87{\textperiodcentered}6 years (86{\textperiodcentered}9-88{\textperiodcentered}1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216{\textperiodcentered}0 deaths (196{\textperiodcentered}3-238{\textperiodcentered}1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38{\textperiodcentered}9 deaths (35{\textperiodcentered}6-42{\textperiodcentered}83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5{\textperiodcentered}4 million (5{\textperiodcentered}2-5{\textperiodcentered}6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. Interpretation: This analysis of age-sex-specifc mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The fndings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which refects signifcant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.},

abstract = {Background: Measures of attributable risk are an integral part of epidemiological analyses, particularly when aimed at the planning and evaluation of public health interventions. However, the current definition of such measures does not consider any temporal relationships between exposure and risk. In this contribution, we propose extended definitions of attributable risk within the framework of distributed lag non-linear models, an approach recently proposed for modelling delayed associations in either linear or non-linear exposure-response associations. Methods: We classify versions of attributable number and fraction expressed using either a forward or backward perspective. The former specifies the future burden due to a given exposure event, while the latter summarizes the current burden due to the set of exposure events experienced in the past. In addition, we illustrate how the components related to sub-ranges of the exposure can be separated. Results: We apply these methods for estimating the mortality risk attributable to outdoor temperature in two cities, London and Rome, using time series data for the periods 1993-2006 and 1992-2010, respectively. The analysis provides estimates of the overall mortality burden attributable to temperature, and then computes the components attributable to cold and heat and then mild and extreme temperatures. Conclusions: These extended definitions of attributable risk account for the additional temporal dimension which characterizes exposure-response associations, providing more appropriate attributable measures in the presence of dependencies characterized by potentially complex temporal patterns.},
